# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to develop a classification model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using features such as age, gender, and ticket class. The model employs a Decision Tree classifier to analyze the provided dataset and determine whether passengers survived or not.

## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the Titanic dataset and predict passenger survival based on various features. The focus is on building a predictive model that can provide insights into the factors that influenced survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including:

- Age
- Gender
- Ticket Class
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
